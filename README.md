# Silent Spring Interactive 3D Environment

## Overview

This web application creates an interactive 3D environment featuring audio elements representing native birds of Aotearoa. As users navigate through the environment as time passes, they experience how the birds' endangerment statuses impact the overall soundscape, illustrating the devastating effects of environmental degradation on our biodiversity.

## Features

- **3D environment:** Explore a dynamic 3D space populated with virtual representations of native birds
- **Audio elements:** Hear bird calls sourced from the Macaulay Library
- **Dynamic soundscape:** Witness how the disappearance of birds due to endangerment changes the sound environment, reflecting the impact of environmental changes
- **Interactive navigation:** Move through time and space to experience different phases of the bird population and their call patterns
